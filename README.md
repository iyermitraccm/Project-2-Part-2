# Project 2 - Web Scraping Analysis
## Task: Scrape data and perform an analysis from different webpages

### To complete this, I chose the website https://www.worldometers.info/ (WorldOMeters) to scrape data about populations, yearly change, density, and more. I used data from different countries and data from years to analyze and identify different patterns in the data. Then, I created visualizations to show trends in the data.

## 4 Data Sciece questions
### There are a few questions that I will be answering:
#### How has the total world population changed from 1950 to 2025?
#### Which countries have experienced the largest population growth (percentage-wise) over the past decade?
#### Is there a relationship between population density and total population size?
#### Which continents contribute the most to global population growth?



## Project Files
